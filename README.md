# Warframe Relic Tracker

This is a fun side project that brings together two things I enjoy doing in my free time: programming in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and playing [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/). The goal is simple: make it easier to find out which relics contain items I want, and track which ones I have already acquired.

As of right now, this is still incomplete, but I'm slowly chipping away and adding features. Once it's completed, this project will be hosted somewhere so other players can use it too (even if they have no interest in programming).

### Roadmap

- [x] Parse JSON
- [x] Display relics & items
